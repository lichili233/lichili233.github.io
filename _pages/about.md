I am a senior ML engineer at Mercari, leading and supporting the development of numerous production and internal projects there, while contributing to academic research. Formerly Bayesian in training and now deep learning in practice, I focus on science-driven applied machine learning research in building interpretable, powerful, robust and scalable machine learning algorithms.

Throughout my industrial service, I explored a diverse set of problem settings and methodologies, ranging from edge-bound to cloud-hosted models, from multimodal encoding to sequential recommendation and generative retrieval, from internal-facing user action behavioral modeling, automatic testing-data generation to external-facing online and offline production microservices and streaming or batch pipelines, be it deep, causal or probabilistic. I also actively work with academic researchers to push the state of the art understanding in large language models, recommendation systems as well as other related topics.

Previously advised by [C. Lee Giles](https://clgiles.ist.psu.edu/) in information retrieval, then briefly and gratefully studied probabilistic machine learning from [Tony Jebara](https://www1.cs.columbia.edu/~jebara/), [David M. Blei](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/), [Andrew Gelman](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/), [Stephan Mandt](https://www.stephanmandt.com/), and [Laurent Charlin](https://mila.quebec/en/person/charlin-laurent/).
