I am an ML tech lead at Cisco, leading the design of numerous research and production agentic AI projects that help customers defend against software vulnerabilities. Previously I was a senior ML engineer and ML tech lead at Mercari, led and supported the development of numerous production and internal projects there. I also contributed to vehicle onboard UX ML and offboard causal inference at Mercedes-Benz Research & Development North America and automated efficiency analysis at BDP EnviroTech. Both within and beyond my primary work, I contribute to state-of-the-art academic research in AI/ML.

Formerly Bayesian in training and now deep learning in practice, I focus on science-driven applied machine learning research in building interpretable, powerful, robust and scalable machine learning algorithms. My expertise grew from extensive algorithmic design as well as the art in training dataset design with respect to each vertical domain, application and use case.

Throughout my industrial service, I explored a diverse set of problem settings and methodologies, ranging from edge-bound to cloud-hosted models, from multimodal encoding to sequential recommendation and generative retrieval, from internal-facing user action behavioral modeling, automatic testing-data generation to external-facing online and offline production microservices and streaming or batch pipelines, be it deep, causal or probabilistic. I also actively work with academic researchers to push the state of the art understanding in large language models, recommendation systems as well as other related topics.

Previously advised by [C. Lee Giles](https://clgiles.ist.psu.edu/) in information retrieval, then briefly and gratefully studied probabilistic machine learning from [Tony Jebara](https://www1.cs.columbia.edu/~jebara/), [David M. Blei](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/), [Andrew Gelman](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/), [Stephan Mandt](https://www.stephanmandt.com/), and [Laurent Charlin](https://mila.quebec/en/person/charlin-laurent/). I majored in Mathematics at Penn State University and subsequently Computer Science at Columbia University.
